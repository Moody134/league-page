  <p>Founded in 2021, the Taco Bowl was established as a Supflex Dynasty League. Each year, the managers will compete to win the Taco Bowl and avoid the ever-humiliating Sandro Bowl.</p>
  <p>Some managers have built immediate win-now teams, while others begin the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league have prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers fled from injuries and down years, others bought the dip and built for the future.</p>
  <p>After many....week....some managers had left but, despite that, the league has only gotten stronger. With more passionate managers, the competition has become more intense and more difficult.</p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious texts to the rest of the league for the next year, the champion manager will walk away with a small amount of prize money.</p>
  <p>The champions of the inaugural season were the Touchdown Jesus's and coach Chad Edwards.</p>
